#StadtLandFluss
This is a little Android game based on the German childrens game "Stadt, Land, Fluss", i.e. city, country, river.
The goal of the game is to find a city, country, river, ... with a given first letter. The score depends on the level of difficulty, time, and of course names for city, country, river, etc. with correct starting letter.
