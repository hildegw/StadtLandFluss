#StadtLandFluss
This is a little Android game based on the German childrens' game "Stadt, Land, Fluss", i.e. city, country, river. In English it's called Scattergories (?).

The goal of the game is to find a city, country, river, ... with a given first letter. There's an option to choose between easy, medium, and difficult letters. Letters are selected randomly. Also, categories can be deselected. The goal is to maximize the score (120 point). The score depends on the level of difficulty, time, and of course correct names entered for city, country, river, and mountain.
